About a year ago I wrote a post describing <a href='http://beckmw.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/how-long-is-the-average-dissertation/'>average length of dissertations</a> at the University of Minnesota.  I've been meaning to expand that post by adding data from Masters theses to get an idea of how the two compare, not just for obvious reasons but also by major.  This post provides some graphics and links to R code for evaluating dissertation (doctorate) and thesis (Masters) data from an online database at the University of Minnesota.  In addition to describing data from Masters theses, I've collected current data on dissertations to provide an update on my previous post.  This blog is essentially a graphical comparison of dissertation versus masters thesis length.  I've avoided presenting the R code for brevity, but I invite interested readers to have a look at my <a href='https://github.com/fawda123/diss_proc'>Github repository</a> where all source code and data are stored.  Also, please, please, please note that I've since tried to explain that dissertation length is a pretty pointless metric of quality (also noted <a href='http://sociologyatwork.org/learning-to-write-a-thesis-an-applied-sociology-perspective/'>here</a>), so interpret the data only in the context that they are potentially descriptive of the nature of each major.

Feel free to fork/clone the <a href='https://github.com/fawda123/diss_proc'>repository</a> to recreate the plots.  The parsed data for theses and dissertations are saved as .RData files, 'thes_parse.RData' and 'diss_parse.RData', respectively. Plots were created in <a href=https://github.com/fawda123/diss_proc/blob/master/thes_plot.R>'thes_plot.r'</a> and <a href=https://github.com/fawda123/diss_proc/blob/master/diss_plot.R>'diss_plot.r'</a>.  The plots comparing the two were created in <a href=https://github.com/fawda123/diss_proc/blob/master/all_plo.R>'all_plo.r'</a>.  To briefly summarize, the dissertation data includes 3037 records from 2006 to present.  This differs from my previous blog by including all majors with at least five records, in addition to the most current data.  The masters thesis data contains 930 records from 2009 to present.  You can get an idea of the relative page ranges for each by taking a look at the plots.  I've truncated all plots to maximum page ranges of 500 and 250 for the dissertation and thesis data, as only a handful of records exceeded these values.  I'm not sure if these extremes are actually real data or entered in error, and to be honest, I'm too lazy to verify them myself.  Just be cautious that there are some errors in the data and all plots are for informational purposes only, as they say...
